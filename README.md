# Database_Formula1

### 1. Project Overview
Azure Databricks data engineering and analytics project using medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers). Build using Apache Spark, Delta Lake, Azure Storage, workflows, analytical dashboards, pipeline for data processing and business reporting.e

### 2. Data Source
The dataset used in this project was provided as part of an educational course and is used here in accordance with the course portfolio usage permission -  "Azure Databricks & Spark Core For Data  Engineers" by Ramesh Retnasamy. 

All engineering, analytics, transformations, dashboards, and architecture implementations are my own work.

The project implements a Medallion Architecture using Unity Catalog in Azure Databricks.

- Landing layer stores source files.
- Bronze layer contains raw ingested data.
- Silver layer contains cleansed and transformed datasets.
- Gold layer contains dimensional models used for reporting and dashboarding
- Analytical layer contains SQL code, dashboards and diagrams
